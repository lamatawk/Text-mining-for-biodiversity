# Text-mining-for-biodiversity

We have developed code that provides the following outputs:

_Excel file that includes the frequency of all words in each PDF, excluding stop words, symbols, and numbers.
_Bar plot for each PDF displaying the most common words.
_ Plot for each PDF illustrating Zipf's law.
_Plot for each PDF comparing the observed Zipf's law with a linear regression based on the data, to assess the similarity to the theoretical behavior.
_ Combined plot showing the results of Zipf's law for all the PDFs.
_Plot comparing the empirical Zipf's law results of all the PDFs with a linear regression using all the data, to evaluate the closeness to the theoretical behavior.
_Plot showing the probability of each word being generated from each topic, as determined by the LDA model. The plot highlights the words with the highest probabilities per topic.
_ Plot displaying the probabilities of each PDF containing each LDA topic.
_Graph network for each PDF, presenting the most relevant bigrams.
_Combined graph network showing the most relevant bigrams among all the PDFs.
_Excel file that contains the frequency of each keyword in each PDF. The keywords are sorted by frequency in descending order per PDF.
_Another file that contains the frequency of each keyword in each PDF. In this case, the keywords are not sorted by frequency, but are maintained in their original order. The file also includes computed statistics for comparison purposes.

This code was written in collaboration with Christie Bahlai, Kathryn Grage, and Juliette Garcia.
